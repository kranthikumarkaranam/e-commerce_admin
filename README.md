- no .env.local, use .env only

- next config image pattern chnage to latest next image pattern

- use mongodb rather than mysql

  - \_id
  - no migration
  - workout with it

- change meta info
- change zod error messages and min text and placeholders or lables anywhere needed
- in creating billboard change the path from userID/billboards -> userID/billboards/new (it looks cleaner for me)
